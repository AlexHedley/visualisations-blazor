      <p>Big O notation is a way of describing the performance of a function without
        using time. Rather than timing a function from start to finish, big O describes
        how the time grows as the input size increases. It is used to help understand
        how programs will perform across a range of inputs.</p>
      <p>In this post I'm going to cover 4 frequently-used categories of big O notation:
        <strong>constant</strong>, <strong>logarithmic</strong>, <strong>linear</strong>, and
        <strong>quadratic</strong>. Don't worry if
        these words mean nothing to you right now. I'm going to talk about them in
        detail, as well as visualise them, throughout this post.

      <p>I'm going to pass in 1 billion, written using the shorthand <code>1e9</code>, so it takes a
        noticeable amount of time to run. Press the <h- key="run"></h-> button below to
        measure how long it takes to calculate the sum of 1 to 1 billion.</p>
      <s-code-timer title="sum(1e9)">
        function sum(n) {
        let total = 0;
        for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) { total +=i; } return total; } const result=sum(1e9); </s-code-timer>
          <p>On my laptop this takes just under 1 second. The time you get may be different,
            and it may vary by a few tens of milliseconds each time you run it. This is
            expected.</p>
          <p>Timing code this way, by taking the start time and the end time and finding the
            difference, is called <b>wall-clock time</b>.</p>
          <p>How long do you think 2 billion, <code>2e9</code>, will take?</p>
          <s-code-timer title="sum(2e9)">
            function sum(n) {
            let total = 0;
            for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) { total +=i; } return total; } const result=sum(2e9); </s-code-timer>
              <p>It takes about twice as long. The code loops <code>n</code> times and does a single
                addition each time. If we passed in 3 billion, we would expect the execution
                time to increase by a factor of three.</p>
              <s-dog position="right" name="sage" mode="proud">
                The relationship between a function's input and how long it takes to execute
                is called its <b>time complexity</b>, and <b>big O notation</b> is how we
                communicate what the time complexity of a function is.
              </s-dog>
              <p>Play around with the buttons below. Each bar adds an extra 1 billion to the <code>n</code>
                that we pass to <code>sum</code>, so the <h- key="run">1e9</h-> button calls <code>sum(1e9)</code>,
                the <h- key="run">2e9</h-> button calls <code>sum(2e9)</code>, and so on. You should see
                <code>2e9</code> take about twice as long as <code>1e9</code>, and <code>3e9</code> take about three
                times as
                long as <code>1e9</code>.

                  <b>Note</b>: On some browsers, you might experience bars taking a lot longer
                  than they should. I wasn't able to figure out why before publishing. If a

              <p>Because <code>sum</code>'s wall-clock time grows at the same rate as <code>n</code>, e.g.
                <code>sum(20)</code>
                would take twice as long as <code>sum(10)</code>, we say that <code>sum</code> is a "linear"
                function. It has a big O of n, or <strong>O(n)</strong>.
              </p>
              <s-dog position="left" name="haskie" mode="confused">
                Why do we use that syntax: <b>O(n)</b>? What is O? Why those brackets?
              </s-dog>
              <p>The "O" stands for "order," short for "order of growth." Said out loud it would
                be: "the order of growth of the <code>sum</code> function is n." <strong>O(n)</strong> is a compact way
                to write that. The notation was created by the German mathematician Paul
                Bachmann in 1894. Also, the "O" (letter) might look like a 0 (number) in some
                typefaces. It is always the letter O.</p>
              <p>A different way to sum the numbers from 1 to n is to use the formula
                <code>(n*(n+1))/2</code>. Here's the result of this formula with the numbers from 1 to 5.
                In each case the result should be the same as doing, e.g. <code>1+2+3+4+5</code> for <code>n=5</code>.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>(1*2)/2 = 2/2  = 1</code></li>
                <li><code>(2*3)/2 = 6/2  = 3</code></li>
                <li><code>(3*4)/2 = 12/2 = 6</code></li>
                <li><code>(4*5)/2 = 20/2 = 10</code></li>
                <li><code>(5*6)/2 = 30/2 = 15</code></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Here's how <code>sum</code> would look if it used that formula instead of the loop we had
                before:</p>

              <p>How do you think the wall-clock time of this function changes as <code>n</code> increases?
                The next two examples <strong>differ by a factor of 100</strong>.</p>
              <s-code-timer title="sum(1e9)">
                function sum(n) {
                return (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
                }
                const result = sum(1e9);
              </s-code-timer>
              <s-code-timer title="sum(100e9)">
                function sum(n) {
                return (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
                }
                const result = sum(100e9);
              </s-code-timer>
              <p>This example isn't broken. Both of these functions take almost no time at
                all. The variance in timing is caused by the browser, and the unpredictability
                of computers, not the <code>sum</code> function. Running each example a few times, you
                should see that the wall-clock time hovers around the same value for both.</p>
              <p>We call functions like this, whose wall-clock time is about the same no matter
                what input you give it, <strong>constant</strong> or <strong>O(1)</strong>.</p>
              <s-dog position="left" name="haskie" mode="triumphant">
                Wow, so we improved our sum function from <b>O(n)</b> to <b>O(1)</b>! It
                always runs instantly now!
              </s-dog>
              <p>We did! Though it is crucial to remember that <strong>O(1)</strong> doesn't <em>always</em> mean
                "instant." It means that <strong>the time taken doesn't increase with the size
                  of the input.</strong> In the case of our new <code>sum</code> function, it's more or less
                instant. But it's possible for an <strong>O(1)</strong> algorithm to take several minutes or
                even hours, depending on what it does.</p>
              <p>It's also possible for an <strong>O(n)</strong> algorithm to be faster than an <strong>O(1)</strong>
                algorithm for some of its inputs. Eventually, though, the <strong>O(1)</strong> algorithm
                will outpace the <strong>O(n)</strong> algorithm as the input size grows. Play with the
                slider below to see an example of that.</p>

              </s-dog>
              <p>The purpose of big O notation is to describe the relationship between the input
                and the wall-clock time of a function. It isn't concerned with what that
                wall-clock time ends up being, only with how it grows.</p>
              <p>Big O describes growth in the smallest terms possible. It would quickly get
                messy if the world had to figure out what number to put inside the brackets for
                every function, and have those numbers be correct relative to each other.
                Likewise, linear functions are always <strong>O(n)</strong> and never <strong>O(2n)</strong> or
                <strong>O(n +
                  1)</strong>, because <strong>O(n)</strong> is the smallest linear term.

                Sorting</h2>
              <p>Let's move away from <code>sum</code> and talk about a different algorithm: <b>bubble
                  sort</b>.</p>
              <p>The idea behind bubble sort is that you loop over the input array and swap
                elements next to each other if they are not in the desired order. You do this
                until you're able to complete a loop through the array without making any swaps.
                It's called bubble sort because of the way numbers "bubble" up to their correct
                position.</p>
              <p>Below is a JavaScript implementation of this algorithm. We're going to sort
                these numbers in ascending order, so the desired result is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
              <p>You can step through this code and watch the array get sorted using the
                controls. <h- key="step"></h-> steps forwards 1 line at a time, <h- key="stepback"></h-> steps
                backwards, <h- key="play"></h-> automatically
                advances forward 1 line every second, and <h- key="restart"></h-> resets back to
                the start.</p>

              <p>Now you've had a look at the algorithm in action, what do you think its big O
                is?</p>
              <p>If the array is already sorted, the algorithm loops through once, does no swaps,
                and exits. This would be <strong>O(n)</strong>. But if the array is in any other order,
                we need to loop through more than once. In the worst case, where the array is
                in reverse order, we would have to loop through <code>n</code> times in order to move the
                smallest element from the end to the start.</p>
              <p>Looping through the <code>n</code> elements of our array <code>n</code> times results in
                <code>n*n</code>
                operations, or <code>n^2</code>. That means <strong>bubble sort is an O(n^2) algorithm</strong>.
                Sometimes called <strong>quadratic.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Because it's common for an algorithm's performance to depend not just on the
                <em>size</em> of the input, but also its arrangement, <strong>big O notation, unless stated
                  otherwise, describes the worst-case scenario</strong>. The same notation can also be
                used for best and average case, but worst case is the default.
              </p>
              <p>Below is another way to visualise bubble sort. It starts off with the array 5,
                4, 3, 2, 1 from top to bottom. The end state should be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 top to
                bottom. Each <h- key="step"></h-> step forward represents a full loop through
                the array, potentially involving multiple swaps. Use <h->Best</h->,
                <h->Worst</h->, and <h->Rand</h-> to see different initial configurations.
              </p>
              <p><s-sort-grid array="5,4,3,2,1"></s-sort-grid></p>
              <p>If you played around with <h->Rand</h-> a few times you'll have noticed that you
                do sometimes get only a couple of iterations. Despite this, bubble sort is still
                <strong>O(n^2)</strong> because in the worst case you'll have to iterate over the array
                <code>n</code> times.

                Searching</h2>
              <p>The last algorithm I want to talk about is <strong>binary search</strong>.</p>
              <p>Let's start with a game. <b>Think of a number between 1 and 100.</b> I'm going
                to try and guess what it is. Use the buttons below to tell me if your number is
                higher or lower than my guess.</p>
              <p><s-higher-or-lower></s-higher-or-lower></p>
              <p>What I'm doing is starting in the middle of the range, 50, and eliminating half
                of the possibilities with each guess. This is a <b>binary search</b>.</p>
              <p>Using this method it will never take more than 7 guesses to find your number.
                This is because we start with 100 possibilities and half of the possibilities
                are ruled out with each guess.</p>
              <p>The table below shows the guessing pattern for all numbers between 1 and 100,
                use the slider to choose a number.</p>
              <p><s-higher-or-lower-table></s-higher-or-lower-table></p>
              <p>When it's possible to eliminate a fraction of possibilities with every step
                of an algorithm, we call it <b>logarithmic</b>. That means that binary search is
                an <strong>O(log n)</strong> algorithm.</p>
              <p>Below is a graph of the number of guesses I would need in order to figure out
                any number between 1 and 1000.</p>
              <s-graph id=guesses style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 2/1;" drawupto=0>
                <axes>
                  <x tics=100 ticformat="tic.toFixed(0)" label="Target number" max=1000>
                    <y tics=2 ticformat="tic.toFixed(0)" label="Max guesses needed" max=10>
                </axes>

    document.getElementById('guesses').setAttribute('drawupto', value)
  ">
              </input>
              <p>Every time the target number doubles, I need 1 extra guess to find it. If you
                were to pick a number between 1 and 1 billion, I would need 31 guesses at most
                to find it. Logarithmic growth is really slow! Below is a graph comparing it to
                <strong>O(n)</strong> and <strong>O(n^2)</strong>, which both grow much faster.

                consider using a data structure that allows for faster lookups, such as a

              <p><em>Building</em> the <code>new Set(items)</code> is an <strong>O(n)</strong> operation! This is

              <p>The problem is calling <code>.indexOf</code> inside the loop. The <code>.indexOf</code> function is an
                <strong>O(n)</strong> operation! It works by looping over the array until it finds the target
                element, returning <code>-1</code> if it doesn't. Calling it inside the loop makes the
                overall big O of our <code>buildList</code> function <strong>O(n^2)</strong>!
              </p>
              <p>To fix this we can loop using an index. Looking up an element in an array by its
                index is <strong>O(1)</strong>, so the overall big O of the function is reduced to
                <strong>O(n)</strong>.

                <li>Big O notation describes the <strong>relationship between a function's input and
                    its wall-clock time</strong>.</li>
                <li>From slowest growth to fastest growth we saw examples of:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>O(1)</strong>, constant time (best!)</li>
                    <li><strong>O(log n)</strong>, logarithmic time</li>
                    <li><strong>O(n)</strong>, linear time</li>
                    <li><strong>O(n^2)</strong>, quadratic time</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We can improve the time complexity of the code we write by making better
                  algorithmic choices and avoiding common pitfalls.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These posts take me a long time to write, and they wouldn't be possible without
                the support of my family, friends, sponsors, and reviewers. I'm so grateful to
                all of you—you know who you are—for making it possible for me to make these.</p>
              <p>If you enjoyed this post, I've written a bunch more similar that you can find <a href="/">on my
                  homepage</a>. I also love hearing from folks that have questions
                or feedback, you can reach me via <a href="mailto:big-o@samwho.dev">email</a>,
                on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samwho.dev">Bluesky</a>, or anonymously via
                my <a href="/ping">silly little ping service</a>.</p>
              <p>I'll leave you with one last graph comparing all of the time complexities we
                covered in this post.</p>
              <s-graph id=final style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 2/1;" drawupto=0>
                <legend position=top-left>
                  <axes>
                    <x tics=10 ticformat="tic.toFixed(0)" max=50>
                      <y tics=10 ticformat="tic.toFixed(0)" max=50>
                  </axes>
                  <lines>
                    <line label="O(1), constant" y="1">
                      <line label="O(log n), logarithmic" y="Math.log(x) / Math.log(2)">
                        <line label="O(n), linear" y="x">
                          <line label="O(n^2), quadratic" y="Math.pow(x, 2)">
                  </lines>
              </s-graph>
              <input aria-label="A slider for controlling the graph lines" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;" type="range"
                value=0 min=0 max=50 step=any oninput="
    document.getElementById('final').setAttribute('drawupto', value)
